# Hey, I'm Moaaz GABALLAH ðŸ‘‹

### Software Engineer, Data scientist researcher, & Tech Enthusiast

I love all things tech. I've been programming since 2015, repairing electronic devices since 10, and founding tech companies since 20. I'm an open source fanatic, Apple fanboy, and love to explore new tech. I spend my time coding open source projects, tinkering with electronics and new tech products, and consulting teams on how to get things done.
